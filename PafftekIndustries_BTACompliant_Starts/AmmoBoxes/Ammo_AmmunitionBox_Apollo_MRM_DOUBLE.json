		"Details": "Improved Medium Range Missiles are a redesign of the MRM from the ground up. By exchanging the propellent for a newer blend and swapping out the explosive core for a shaped charge the missilesâ€™ aerodynamic structure was able to be refined. This lead to an all around improvement in accuracy through improved aerodynamics and fin stabilization. Upon receiving a Critical Hit, any remaining ammunition stored inside an Ammo Bin will explode dealing damage to the install location. Risk can be mitigated with the use of C.A.S.E. Has 450 shots.",
