		"Details": "Contrected out to Pafftek Industries, this second Source of Drillsons were modified slightly from the base 3053 variants.  Like the later Scarborough Manufactures' MML variant, the Pafftek Version downgraded the engine to that a Fusion 165 by VOX.  Interestingly the Vox 165 Fusion core is only noted in the Ambasador as far as combat units are concerned.  In place of the Machineguns, a DS Aero PIP Laser AMS was installed.  The Large Pulse Laser was converted into an ER Large Laser, with associated FCS, and the Streak SRMs were downgraded to standard SRMs but wtih two 1/2 ton bins of ammunition, both Acid and Tandem Rounds were carried typically.  The extra tonnage freed allowed the LRM unit to be upgraded to an FCS Equipped LRM15 with two tons of ammunition.  Rounding out the upgrades are a C3 Slave and Ammunition is CASE protected. \n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Hover: Fast on open ground and water, slow in rough terrain, not very agile, cannot move through woods.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 8/12 Hex: 240/360 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       144     25\n<b>Left</b>         100     25\n<b>Right</b>       100     25\n<b>Rear</b>         90     25\n<b>Turret</b>      130     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      564    125\n",
