    "Details": "Oddball was the origional leader of the Hell-Wolves mercenary company during its formation and inital forays during \"Operation Serpent.\"  Being a relitively new Merc-company, the Hell-Wolves were deployed in garrioson actions and not as a part of the main thrust.  However the speed of the attack meant many enemy units were bypassed and it fell to the garrisons to fight them.   After a particularly hard drubbing which cost the Hell-Wolves over half their functional units Oddball stepped down and for a while was a tank pilot before returning as a Test pilot for the newly formed Pafftek Industries.",
