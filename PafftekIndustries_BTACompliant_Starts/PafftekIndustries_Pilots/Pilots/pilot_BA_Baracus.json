		"Details": "Growing up poor, BA learned to always keep his money with him. hence the outlanding ammount of gold arround his neck.  In a Mech Cockpit this actually helps keep him cool... until it does not.   However it offeres no issues while piloting a Vehicle.  BA is notoriously uncomfortable in flying craft and prefers to stick with wheeled or Tracked vehicles.  Even Hovercraft and WiGE craft cause him discomfort.",
