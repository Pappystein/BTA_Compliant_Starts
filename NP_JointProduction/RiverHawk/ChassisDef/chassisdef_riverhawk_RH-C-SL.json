		"Details": "The River Hawk is arguably the greatest failure ever produced by the RAD Group, being originally built for the Star League in 2739 shortly after the Osprey was created, with many referring to it as a '100 ton Charger' thanks to the standard RH-A-SL's massive RADTech 400 standard fusion engine, which in combination with it's underwhelming weapons setup and a pathetic 10.5 tons of standard armor quickly led to the mech suffering the same fate as the Charger it is often likened to during the Star League era, and also like the Charger, would be saved as a desperate and shattered RAD Group found the production line for the chassis was one of the few left functioning and would manage to sell these machines to the Great Houses during the Succession Wars despite it's flaws, meaning the chassis can be found semi-frequently throughout the Inner Sphere. The RH-C-SL is a model designed for the Star League's Royal Regiments, and is a much more dangerous machine to face than either of it's Star League era siblings, thanks to advanced technology employed on it, sporting a much lighter abeit more fragile RADTech 400 XL Engine that lets it mount an additional 6.5 tons of armor, making armor breaches much less common, while an Endo-Steel chassis further saves weight for a much nastier array of weapons; a Gauss Rifle allows for low heat sniping, while an ER PPC and ER Large Laser are effective at short to their max ranges, and a Medium Laser and a Small Laser come into play up close for additional firepower, with a Small Pulse Laser being installed to replace the Machine Gun for anti-infantry duty. A MASC unit is installed to boost the mech's already above average speed (for it's size) even further, while 18 Double Heat Sinks keep the mech nice and chilly for the most part.",
